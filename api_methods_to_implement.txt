Authentications/{userid}:


Notes:
- How JPA Many to many relationship works in the SQL database: Each entity has a hashset in POJO of the other. [VERY BAD SOLUTION: Bidirectional relationships are very hard to maintain in Java].

JPARepository extends CRUD and PagingAndSortingRepository.

- Users should have its own API server, with only the authentication endpoint.

ToTryout:
- Different JPA configurations for many to many
- RestController instead of Controller (play with return type ResponseEntity vs just the Java POJO)
- @Override need to copy annotations? No
- @Valid marks a component or a method for javax validation.
